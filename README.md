## About <a name = "about"></a>

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) NSG Python Script is a script that will create a NSG & associated Security Rules in OCI.

It was created to allow for easy creation of NSGs for use with Cloudflare's [IP Lists](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) in mind for my own use, but could be adapted to do more than just for Cloudflare's IP Lists.
Of couse you could also use `Terraform` to perform this automations as well, but I like python üêç more.

The script can currently create a NSG with the following rules:

- Allow all traffic from Cloudflare IPv4s and/or IPv6s to the TCP HTTP (80) port
- Allow all traffic from Cloudflare IPv4s and/or IPv6s to the TCP HTTPS (443) port
- Allow all traffic from Cloudflare IPv4s and/or IPv6s to the UDP HTTPS (443) port for QUIC/HTTP3
